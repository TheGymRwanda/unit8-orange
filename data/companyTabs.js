            We believe that blockchain technology has the potential to shift financial models as we know them, creating revenue streams that are more sustainable and fair for users. We envision a future in which financial infrastructures are rather decentralised and horizontal, in which any member can have a say. Through its immutability, blockchain technology provides trustworthy infrastructures that allow cooperation on a large scale.
